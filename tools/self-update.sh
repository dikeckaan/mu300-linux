# Bring this copy of the project up to date with GitHub before the installer does anything: an old installer
# is how people ended up with old fixes long after new ones were published. Sourced by install.sh; uses say(),
# t(), $TOP and $REPO. Nothing here may stop an install: without GitHub (offline, blocked, rate-limited) it says
# so and the local copy runs.
#   git clone:  fast-forward to GitHub's main (not with local changes, not when this copy is ahead of it)
#   zip/tarball download:  replace the files that differ from GitHub's main; the commit checked is kept in
#               .mu300-source, so the next run downloads nothing when there is nothing new. Paths listed in
#               .mu300-keep (one per line, # comments; not part of the project) stay as they are - a copy with
#               fixes of its own keeps them (install.ps1 does the same, issue #6)
#   MU300_NO_SELF_UPDATE=1  skip all of this
