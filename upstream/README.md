# Mainline (LTS) kernel on the MU300

Mainline **Linux 6.18.54** (the current longterm series) runs Ubuntu 24.04 and OpenWrt 25.12 on the ZTE F50 /
MU300 (Unisoc UMS9620): all 8 CPUs (4×A55, 4×A76), eMMC, USB NCM + ACM, the 5 GHz hotspot, Bluetooth, the modem
with mobile data (downlink and uplink), SMS, the VPN, the Mali GPU, thermal/cpufreq, the PMIC watchdog and
reboot. `docs/FINDINGS.md` 31-31f has what it took and what is still open.

On a device: `sudo mu300-update kernel 6.18` (from a release that carries `mu300-kernel-6.18.tar.gz`), and
`sudo mu300-update kernel 5.4` back. Both kernels' modules stay installed.

Reference: Unisoc's UMS9620 DT series (LKML, 2023-12-15, "arm64: dts: sprd: Add support for Unisoc's UMS9620", not
merged) describes the same GIC/UART/timer layout; this device is derived from their ums9620-2h10 reference board.

## How it boots
* **Device tree:** the stock vendor DTB in `vendor_boot` is used unchanged. Mainline ignores the vendor-only nodes and
  uses the standard ones (cpus, psci, GIC, timer, memory, reserved-memory, ramoops, ADI). A minimal custom DTB
  (`dts/ums9620-mu300.dts`, installed with `mkvendorboot.py`) was *rejected*: after LK's dtbo merge and fixups the kernel
  hung in `setup_machine_fdt`.
* **Load address:** LK always copies the kernel to 0x80080000 (old text_offset); `wrap-image.py` prepends a branch stub
  so the Image runs from 0x80200000 (2 MiB aligned).
* **Reset:** PSCI SYSTEM_RESET never returns on this firmware. `patches/0001-spi-sprd-adi-add-UMS9620-restart.patch`
  adds the UMS9620/UMP9620 variant to `spi-sprd-adi` (also matching the vendor compatible `sprd,qogirn6pro-adi`) and
  resets through the PMIC software reset, registered above the PSCI handler.
* **Logs:** with a working reset the console survives in ramoops and Android shows it as
  `/sys/fs/pstore/console-ramoops-0` (`tools/collect-logs.sh`).

## Build and test
```sh
docker build -t mu300-mainline-build upstream/
docker volume create mu300-mainline   # build.sh fetches linux-$KV (default 6.18.54) into it, checked against kernel.org
docker run --rm -v mu300-mainline:/src -v "$PWD/upstream":/work mu300-mainline-build bash /work/build.sh
docker run --rm -v mu300-mainline:/src -v "$PWD/upstream":/work mu300-mainline-build bash /work/build-modules.sh
upstream/make-bundle.sh mu300-kernel-6.18.tar.gz        # Image for LK, generic ramdisk segment, modules
# on the device: MU300_KERNEL_BUNDLE=/path/mu300-kernel-6.18.tar.gz mu300-update boot
```
The build stops on anything that drifts silently: a patch that neither applies nor is applied, a config option
Kconfig does not take (unless listed in `config-ignored.txt`), a port edit whose anchor moved, or a module whose
vermagic does not match the kernel. `tools/make-release.sh` packages the same bundle as `mu300-kernel-6.18.tar.gz`.

The bring-up path of old (hand-built image, `init-bringup`, `boot/flash-trial.sh`) still works for experiments:
```sh
python3 upstream/wrap-image.py upstream/out/Image upstream/out/Image.lk
boot/flash-trial.sh boot-mainline.img      # slot b only, falls back to Android
```

## Debugging without a console
* `stub/pmic-reset.c`: bare-metal PMIC reset used as the kernel entry — proved that LK reaches our code and that the
  PMIC reset works (30 s cycle instead of the ~320 s PM power cut).
* `debug/install-probe.py` (`MU300_PROBE_STAGE=N` for `build.sh`): resets at a chosen boot stage; the cycle time tells
  whether the stage was reached. This located the custom-DTB hang in `setup_machine_fdt`.

## Newer kernels (7.x)

The whole port - kernel and all 31 out-of-tree modules - also builds against **7.2.8**, the newest stable release
(2026-09-26), from the same sources as 6.18; it has not been run on the device yet. One source serves both:

* `port/install.py` recognises the layout of what it edits (`sprd-sc27xx-spi.c` was reworked in 7.x), and every
  edit is checked afterwards, so a drifted anchor stops the build instead of being skipped.
* The modules get the missing pieces from `modules/wcn_bsp/kinclude`: `mu300_compat.h` (7.x-only shims:
  `strncpy`, alarmtimer, `linux/hex.h`) and `linux/of_gpio.h`, a shim kbuild only finds when the kernel has no
  such header. API changes that need more than a shim are under `LINUX_VERSION_CODE` (the cfg80211 ops taking a
  `wireless_dev`, `dma_fence_signal()` returning nothing).
* `.github/workflows/mainline.yml` builds the port every week against the current longterm and the newest stable
  release, so the next break shows up as a red run rather than at the next jump.

To try another version: `KV=7.2.8` for `build.sh` and `build-modules.sh`.

## Remaining mainline work (as of 2026-09-26)

- The forced command line still carries the bring-up crutches `clk_ignore_unused pd_ignore_unused
  regulator_ignore_unused fw_devlink=permissive` - they cost power, and taking them out needs a way to measure it.
- The early crashes and the missing OpenWrt downlink were one bug, the delegate's (FINDINGS 31f), fixed; one
  Ubuntu boot that died early before the crash capture existed (31d) is unexplained, and has not recurred in the
  reboot loops since (Ubuntu 6/6, OpenWrt 4/4).
- Poweroff has not been tried (it needs someone at the device to switch it on again).
- Audio: not ported (it does not work on 5.4 either).

## Earlier status notes
Clocks, pinctrl, power domains, USB 3.1 gadget, eMMC, PCIe, thermal, cpufreq, watchdog, LEDs and Wi-Fi/BT are
working (see the status below). What is still missing:

- ~~**Modem**~~: works since 2026-09-19 - "Modem Alive", AT, SIM, 5G NSA registration and a data context on
  `sipa_eth0`. See "Modem on 6.18" below for what was wrong (shared memory mapped write-back).
- **PM co-processor**: without Android's `modem_control` the board powers off after ~290 s, so the vendor chroot is
  still required.
- ~~**GPU**~~: works since 2026-09-19 (DDK r40p0 ported to 6.18, OpenCL verified on the device).
- **Audio**: not started.
- **Bluetooth**: built as an out-of-tree module, untested on 6.18.

## Modem on 6.18: working (2026-09-19)

The modem comes up on the mainline kernel: "Modem Alive", AT, SIM, radio, **registration on 5G NSA** and a data
context with an address on `sipa_eth0`. Measured on the device:

```
AT         -> OK                                   AT+CFUN?  -> +CFUN: 1
AT+CPIN?   -> +CPIN: READY                         AT+CSQ    -> +CSQ: 37,20
AT+CEREG?  -> +CEREG: 2,1,"C300","00E07F53",13     AT+COPS?  -> +COPS: 0,2,"28602",13
mobile data up on sipa_eth0 (28602)                sipa_eth0  UP  10.x.x.x/8
```

### What was wrong: the shared memory was mapped write-back

The regions the modem and the AP share are reserved **inside** System RAM (no `no-map`), and the vendor 5.4 driver
maps them with `vm_map_ram(pages, count, -1, pgprot_noncached(PAGE_KERNEL))`. Newer kernels dropped the `prot`
argument from `vm_map_ram()`, so the port had switched to `memremap(..., MEMREMAP_WC | MEMREMAP_WB)`, which falls
back to **write-back** whenever write-combine is not available - and it never is for a linear-mapped region.

The modem does not snoop the AP's caches, so everything the AP wrote stayed invisible to it. The symptom was
subtle rather than fatal: the CP started, asked for its NV data, and the NV server logged `fail SIZE` on the
second packet, wrote three chunks and stalled; `modem_control` then gave up with `wait modem alive timeout` and
`g_modem_state = 8`. `ioremap_wc()` is not an answer either - the kernel refuses it for addresses inside System
RAM (`WARNING at arch/arm64/mm/ioremap.c:27`), which is exactly what happened when it was tried.

`vmap(pages, count, VM_MAP, prot)` still takes a pgprot, so `smem.c` now builds the page array like the vendor
driver and maps the regions non-cached again, keeping `memremap()` only for regions that have no `struct page`
(real `no-map`) and for the ones the vendor code wants cached.

Before and after, from the same logs:

| | write-back (before) | non-cached (after) |
|---|---|---|
| `fail SIZE` | 1 | 0 |
| NV packets served (`writeData`) | 3 | runs to completion |
| "Modem Alive" | never | yes |

### Bring-up

`tools/mu300-modem-ml-load` loads 25 modules (no `sipa-dele`, see its comment). `cp_diskserver` is started first,
`modem_control` about 8 s later. "Modem Alive" arrives within a minute, and `mu300-atd` then serves AT normally -
15 commands in a row with no reopen needed.

### GPU

`mali_kbase` (Arm DDK r40p0, the same source the 5.4 image uses) builds against 6.18 after a port of its kernel
interfaces: `time_t`, `hrtimer_init()` -> `hrtimer_setup()`, `del_timer*()` -> `timer_delete*()`, the shrinker
allocation API, `vma->vm_flags` accessors, `get_user_pages()`/`pin_user_pages()` losing their `vmas` argument,
`dev_pm_opp_set_regulators()` returning a token, `ioremap_nocache()`, `DEFINE_SEMAPHORE()` taking a count,
`no_llseek`, `FMODE_UNSIGNED_OFFSET`, `get_file_rcu()`, devfreq's `scaling_min_freq`/`scaling_max_freq`, and the
page-migration hooks, which the folio conversion replaced and which are compiled out (migration is an
optimisation the driver runs without).

Two of them were more than renames:

* The DDK carries its own copy of the kernel's top-down address search, which walked the VMA **rbtree** - gone
  since 6.1. `vm_unmapped_area()` is not exported to modules, so the search now walks downwards with
  `find_vma()` and keeps the DDK's extra alignment rules (shader code must not touch a 4 GB boundary).
* Its `Kbuild` adds the power model (`ipa/`) to `mali_kbase-y` and a later line **reassigns** that variable with
  `:=`, dropping the objects again. Nobody noticed because the vendor kernel sets
  `CONFIG_SPRD_GPU_COOLING_DEVICE` and never uses `ipa/`; mainline does, and the module then fails to link. The
  include was moved to the end of the file.

The kernel config gained `CONFIG_SYNC_FILE` (the DDK's fence helpers) and the devfreq options the driver expects.

Measured on the device: the driver probes, `/dev/mali0` appears and the Android OpenCL userspace runs through the
vendor chroot - `Mali-G57 r0p1, OpenCL 3.0 v1.r40p0`, 1464 MiB, and `cltest` adds 4 194 304 floats on the GPU with
**0 errors**.

The address search was worth one more round: the first version returned `gap_end - length`, but
`align_and_check()` has already subtracted the length, so every allocation landed one buffer too low. The driver
loaded and OpenCL ran, and every single result was wrong - a reminder that "it runs" is not "it works".

Still open: audio is untouched.

## Status (2026-09-17): OpenWrt runs on 6.18.52

The installed OpenWrt 25.12.5 boots on the mainline kernel through the normal `boot/init`
(multi-OS switch_root): SSH, LuCI, `br-lan` over the USB 3.1 gadget, fw4/nftables, zram.

Fixes needed on top of the port:

- `sdhci-sprd`: UMS9620 has the r11p3 controller; the vendor driver programs DLL phase `0x2`
  (mainline `0x3`). With `0x3` reads work in HS400ES but every write fails with data CRC errors.
- `sdhci-sprd`: only the non-removable eMMC is probed (the SD slot is unpopulated and floods the log).
- UMP9620 PMIC watchdog, armed by LK for 300 s, is disabled by `ump9620-pmic-wdt-off`.
- Userspace config: cgroups/namespaces/seccomp, bridge, nftables, IPv6, zram.
- Thermal: vendor `sprd_thermal_r5p0` (19 on-die zones) with calibration from the UMS9620 eFuse; the eFuse
  provider is built read-only.
- cpufreq: vendor `sprd_sip_svc` + `sprd-cpufreq-v2`; ATF does the DVFS, the kernel asks through SIP SMC calls
  (3 policies: 4 little / 3 mid / 1 big, schedutil). PSCI cpuidle (WFI, core sleep, cluster power-down).
  Idle temperature dropped from ~54 C to ~48 C.
- The stock DT has trip points only on the vendor virtual zone, so `/opt/mu300/bin/thermal-guard` caps cpufreq
  above 85 C and powers off above 105 C on kernels without SoC trip points.

- Watchdog: the UMP9620 PMIC watchdog that LK arms is taken over (`ump9620-pmic-wdt`), 60 s, pinged by the
  core until procd/systemd opens it; a hard hang resets the board back to Android.
- LEDs: UMP9620 RGB status LEDs (vendor `sc27xx-bltc`).
- PCIe: vendor `pcie-sprd` ported to the 6.18 DWC host API. `num-vectors` from the DT is honoured, the
  Marlin3 driver needs a contiguous block of 32 MSIs.
- Wi-Fi/BT (SC2355 Marlin3): `modules/` holds the vendor `wcn_bsp`, `sprd_wlan_combo` (SC2355 PCIe only) and
  `sprdbt_tty` ported to 6.18 as out-of-tree modules (`build-modules.sh`; `tools/port54.py` does the mechanical
  5.4 API changes, `wcn_bsp/kinclude/mu300_compat.h` the rest). On OpenWrt the chip boots its firmware and the
  5 GHz VHT80 AP beacons. The factory Wi-Fi MAC is read from `androidboot.wifimac` in `/chosen/bootargs`.
  The WCN modules cannot be unloaded and reloaded (same as on 5.4).

Not yet on mainline: modem (sipc/sipa/modem loader), GPU, audio; Bluetooth is built but untested.
